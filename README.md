# COLLECTOR'S WORLD

The final objective for this project was to pivot an existing Ruby on Rails online commerce platform  to a bidding platform for collectibles. 

### Learning Goals

* Use TDD to drive all layers of Rails development including unit, integration, and user acceptance tests
* Design a system of models which use one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many relationships
* Practice mixing HTML, CSS, and Rails templates to create an inviting and usable User Interface
* Differentiate responsibilities between components of the Rails stack
* Build a logical user-flow that moves across multiple controllers and models
* Practice an agile workflow and improve communication skills working within a team
* Implement a Background-Worker that handles sending text message/email notifications when the auction is over.
