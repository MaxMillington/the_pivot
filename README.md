# REDRUM NURSERY

The final objective for this project was to use Ruby on Rails to build an online commerce platform to facilitate online ordering. For fun we also experimented with integrating Stripe for payment processing and Twilio for sending SMS upon receiving payment as well as allowing an 'admin' to call a customer from the browser.

### Learning Goals

* Use TDD to drive all layers of Rails development including unit, integration, and user acceptance tests
* Design a system of models which use one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many relationships
* Practice mixing HTML, CSS, and Rails templates to create an inviting and usable User Interface
* Differentiate responsibilities between components of the Rails stack
* Build a logical user-flow that moves across multiple controllers and models
* Practice an agile workflow and improve communication skills working within a team
